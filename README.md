# Pre-Amp
pre-amp build with valves and a Raspberry Clone

Hi,
i'm documenting here my schematics and pcb plans for my pre-amp with electronic tubes. I have some fundamentals:

- no HV for the electron tubes. I dont need POWER, i need a nice and clean signal.
- If i'm doing electronic tubes, i want to use them wherever i can.
- i'm not trying to save money here.
- i do things because i can.
